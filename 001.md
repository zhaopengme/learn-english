The Linux File System explained in 1,233 seconds

welcome to linux for hackers and everyone, because everyone needs to learn linux in episode. One. We learned a lot if you haven't seen it yet go check it out, but that sucker just scratched the surface in episode, two, which is right now we're going deeper, we're going crazy, no time to waste. Let'S start right now: [, Music, ]! Now, just like episode, one in the series you're getting a free linux lab to play with right now, all thanks to my sponsor hack, the box academy. So if you haven't already signed up link below, i walk you through it in episode 1. So go check that out and before we get started. Have you hacked the youtube algorithm today, like this video subscribe comment: notification bell, let's hack youtube today, ethically of course anyways yeah. Let'S get started all right before we get started, we'll need two things. First, coffee check got it next, we'll need our lab. Our linux lab free from hack, the box academy, go to get logged in right here and then we'll jump back into our linux fundamentals course and launch our phone box here at the very bottom. Go ahead and click on start instance boom. Now, if you have no idea what i'm talking about here like what free linux will have go back to episode, one i'll show you how to set this up. Anyways, let's keep going and then we'll click interact to launch our linux box and the browser which is crazy, still so cool to me. Anyways, let's go now in episode, one we covered that you don't experience linux like this. No, no! No! We'Re gon na launch our linux terminal right here, go ahead and do that. It'S that green or yellow icon right there, ah we're home. Yes, now real quick! Who am i go ahead and type that in real quick? Who am i no spaces just type that in hit enter? That'S our first command today, just a quick, little fun command. That tells us who we are, who we are logged in as - and i am user 86527 who are you comment below just in case in linux? You ever have an identity crisis you're like man who am i you can find out real, quick moving on. So last time, in episode, one, we learned a few things like hey ls. Our list command will tell us all the stuff in our current working directory. We also learn cd. We can change directories to something else where we're not like cd desktop now we're in desktop. If i type in pwd it'll also tell me where i am i'm in desktop, because we just went there and we even saw that we type in cd space dot, dot. It'Ll, take us back so now we're back where we started, and but if we keep going cd, dot, dot, cd dot dot, we go back and back and back until we can't go back anymore, which is where we're at right now forward slash the root. If i type in pwd that's where we are the root of the file system, that's where it all starts and that's where we're starting our video today and i'm going to clear my screen, real quick just by typing in clear, hey another command, just type and clear It'Ll clear your terminal, so it's nice and clean, like a dry erase board clear now, what's here, what's at the root of the file system, let's see go ahead and type in ls right now, ls ooh, a bunch of stuff, let's find out what it is, but Before we do that, i want to get one big idea across to you real, quick. Those will help you understand things as we go forward. Everything - and i mean everything and linux is a file literally everything like configuration, like your network settings things like your ip address and all that interface stuff. It'S a file devices like your hard drives and your printers and your cd-roms all files they are represented in a file in linux, now even more shocking and crazy. The commands we use are also files, ls and all the commands. We just learned they're files. What you don't believe me, let me show you, let's jump in there i'll show you where they live this first directory right here, our bin directory. I feel like i'm calling him ben hi ben, let's jump in there real, quick, let's jump into ben, that's weird anyways! So we'll do cd bin to jump in there and we're there by the way ben stands for binaries. You know computer speak and inside the bin. Folder or directory are the command binaries. Let'S take a look inside, let's type ls, to list all the contents and whoa. That was a lot, and here are a lot of the commands. You'Ll end up using in linux. In fact, within the bin, folder are the essential command binaries. So, let's scroll up and let's, let's find ls like it's here and the l's. Let me let me scroll up there. Ah there he is ls that sucker is a file. The command you use to list files is itself a file right now. If this is a file, we should be able to bust it open and see. What'S inside right. Yes, we can. Let'S do that. It'S new command time, so let me show you this command. First, i'm going to clear things out by tapping clear or i can actually do - control l to clear, yeah, nice and clear this new command. We have is cat cat, that's it! Cat stands for con cat innate. Did i spell that right, yeah i did yeah and like any cat, this command will take a file and just throw it up on your terminal in the output. Let'S try it. Let'S cat ls cat ls. That is a lot of spit up there now. Do you understand any of this, because if you do, you might be a robot where's, my captcha for this course, but anyways. You should not understand this. It'S the command binary when you type in ls. This is what it tells the computer to do now check this out to further illustrate that this is indeed a file. I'M going to do something with it or to it i'm going to delete it. You can delete files, so let's delete this file now. First, you got to back it up so new command time. Here we go, i'm going to clear things out, i'm going to back up my ls command, or rather i'm going to copy it. So here we go new command. Cp cp stands for copy and that's pretty much what it means. No further explanation needed. So after cp we'll reference the file we want to copy so ls space and then the file we want to copy it to i'll name it. I don't know network chuck, you can name it whatever you want. Ah can't do it permission denied. How do we fix that? Well, sometimes in linux, you have to say, please i mean not really but kind of to give ourselves permission real, quick for this one command, we'll type in the sudo command before our command, so sudo cp ls network check. Now we will end up covering what sudo means or su do, but for right now just know we weren't allowed to use the copy command in this directory. We didn't have the permissions, but by using the sudo command we can pretend to be the root or the admin user for just that one command and we can run it. So, let's try it out totally worked. So here's what we did. We have the ls command. Still there, but we also have a new command. That'S just network chuck, that's because we copied the binary contents of ls to a new file named network chuck and if we try to use that command, what do you think will happen? Let'S try it out network chuck. It'S the ls command, that's that's kind of cool right anyways. Let'S delete the ls command. We can do that. Let me clear my screen once more new command time. The command will be r m. Very simple: two letter commands right now. Rm stands for remove and much like the copy command, no explanation necessary. It removes crap, it removes stuff, so i'll say, remove ls now, as you may imagine, we'll also need pseudo permissions to remove this so i'll go to the beginning of my command and type in sudo, so sudo rmls and it's going to go away, say bye. It'S gone so now. What do you think will happen if we type in ls? Let'S try it ls nope it's gone, but not a big deal like we still have network chuck. Don'T we, it still does the same thing so we're good, but for real to return. It back to normal. All we got to do is sudo copy once more, just cp right. We want to copy the contents of network chuck to a new file named ls, so now, if we type in ls once more, ah we're back we're good. Now, let's talk about ben again ben he's got all the essential command binaries like we talked about things like the commands. We just learned: cp copy, rm, remove and even cat there. He is, which also means we can cat cat. Let'S try it out cat cat and we just catted cat anyways, let's move on so i'm gon na cd, dot, dot or cd forward slash to get back to our route. Let'S clear things out once more and let's list the contents once more of root. So we talked about ben the the bend directory he's awesome, but there's also another one over here called s ben or i like to refer to it as super ben ben with a cape on now super ben is just like ben, but he's a bit more special. You see super ben has special commands that only administrators would use to administer the system. Let me show you, let's jump into super bent, so cd s bin and if we ls inside super bin or list as contents, we'll see some cool commands. Some top secret commands that only admins can use we'll take a look at one and actually use it real quick. Let me score the top here. Ah here we go add user. What do you think that does wild guess? It'S going to add ourselves a user. So, let's do that real, quick, i'm going to clear my screen and we'll do sudo, because this is a special command, we'll need, please please add user and then the username. Now this is new command time. I forgot to say it new command time. I'M going to create super ben, i feel like he should have a presence right now, so sudo add user super bin and it's creating we'll give a password to super bin. Give him a full name. Super bin skip the rest of the stuff. Super ben is alive. He'S here we added a user but anyways. That'S what you see in sbin super bing commands. Let'S get back out of there, cd dot, dot and clear my screen once more. Let'S do ls and see what we're working with again. Now we're still going to talk about commands for a bit we're not quite done ben had our essential commands. Super bin had our super essential commands, but now we're going to jump into our user directory, let's jump in there real, quick, so cd user usr type in ls, while we're there and notice something kind of strange it might throw you off inside the usr directory or The user directory we also have a ben and an s bin huh. What'S going on here, something's up, let's take a look inside so cd into ben, but inside the user directory. Let'S ls that looks like a lot of the same things. Doesn'T it like? Is there an ls here, yep so same commands here, let's jump back for a second cd dot dot and then jump into s ben here inside the user directory, let's ls that yup seems to have the same commands here too. What'S going on, it seems like we have some imposters here like which one is the real one, ben and root or been in the user directory. The answer is both they're, both real there's actually a pretty interesting history as to why we have two locations. I'M not going to talk about it here, but it all comes down to hard drive space. Look it up, but essentially the ben and the super bin directories. In the user directory are the same as the ben and s bin in the root directory. Now ben and s, ben in the user directory will typically have more commands there, but you will see a ton of overlap here. So that begs the question: when we use the ls command, are we using the command stored in bin or in user bin? We can actually find out. You want to try it. Let'S try it out new command time, go ahead and clear your screen with me here. We'Re going to type in the command which it's going to help us figure out, which is it is it in bin or is it in user bin, so type in which and then right after that, ls hit enter? Ah so it's the ls and user bin. If we, which cat it's also in user forward, slash ben, which, if you didn't catch on what, which is doing, i feel like i'm saying, which too much you can use which to find out where your command binaries live. So i can actually which that command. I made earlier which network chuck so that's pretty cool and that's extremely handy, so anyways, let's um, get back to our user directory cd dot dot, let's ls once more! So again, here in our user directory, we have ben and super bin carbon copies, but a bit more power. We also have a local directory, which you can hardly see. Let me back up there. Our local directory, which similar to ben and super bin will store command. Binaries, but it's here that you'll want to store the command binaries that you might create anyways. Let'S move on the user directory also has some fun stuff, like libraries that the command binaries will share, and apparently it has games, that's fun, so we don't use a directory. Let'S get out of there cd dot dot, let's ls once more to see our root location here now real quick speed route boot. What is that files? Your system needs to boot boot files self-explanatory. Let'S move on var will have things like log files and also web application related files, we'll talk more about that later, temp or tmp temporary files, files that go away after a system reboot or something another lib directory, more shared library files, specifically things your system needs To boot, okay, speed round done some more stuff. Some more key directories here in the route first home home is where you live home is where we live. In fact, it's where every user lives on your system. Let'S take a look inside cd home now, what's ls there, real, quick, aha, two homes, one is our home and then one hey super bend has a home too. If we see the it's a super bin and ls his stuff. Ah there's his house all right. We'Re on welcome here, let's get out of here: let's get back to our route. Now every linux system has a root user, but we didn't see a home for the route. Where does he live because he wasn't in this home, but you may have noticed that he is over here all by himself he's special. He lives somewhere else where people can't bother him he's kind of a recluse or a recluse. I don't know how to emphasize that. We can list the contents of root: let's do a pseudo, because we'll need his special permissions to look inside his house, sudo ls root and we're looking inside the root directory, there's all his stuff anyways. Let'S keep moving now earlier. I mentioned that even devices in our system are files hard drives printers cd-roms. You want to see them they're right here in the dev directory. Dev stands for devices. Let'S go. Take a look: well: cd, dev! Let'S ls that sucker! Oh a lot of weird stuff going on now. We could spend all day here, but we're not going to we're going to look at one thing: vda and vda1. Those right now are our hard drives. They stand for virtual disks on other linux systems. You might see this listed as sda or sda1 and that's our hard drive. That'S the disk, it's a file, which means we can cap that sucker. So let's do that now it's! This is gon na be a little rough. It might scare you and i'll show you how to stop it here in a second, but we're going to do this, we're going to cat our drive cat vda. I believe we will need pseudo permission so i'll put a pseudo here at the beginning, ready for this. It'S going to blow up and it's gon na keep going hurry, hit, control c and it stops yeah whoo, but yeah. That'S all the binary and gobbledygook and all the stuff that your hard drive is it's a stinking file which is really cool and really really weird. You know but anyways the dev directory is where devices live. Now. I also mentioned that the settings of your linux server or your linux computer are files. Things like your network settings are stored inside a file. You want to see it. Let'S go see it real quick. These things are stored in the etc file which stands for etc. Officially, i think so you might hear it referred to as the etc file or directory, but people mainly call it in the linux world the etsy file, which was here first before etsy.com, so they stole the idea, but let's jump in there real quick, let's jump into Our etsy file so we'll see the etc you'll go here. A lot because configuration files of your system are here as well as some applications. They can throw some stuff in there too, if we lsd, etc directory a ton of stuff almost too much stuff. But let's focus on one set of configurations: let's focus on networking so right here, we've got our network directory, let's jump in there, cd network, let's lsd network directory - and we got a few things going on here. But the thing i want you to see is the interfaces file. Let'S take a look at that. Let'S cap that sucker cat interfaces - ah we need to say please sudo cat interfaces. There we go here in a file. Are your network interfaces and they're assigned ip addresses? This is where they're configured pretty cool, and if you wanted to change your network settings, you would often go into this file and just change it here. Now things do work differently on some linux systems nowadays, but this was a common way to do it and is still the common way to do on some systems. Now we're almost done. I know it's been a lot, but i got to cover this. I'Ve got. I got to show you this stuff: let's get back to our route cd forward, slash clear the screen two more places. I want to talk about, let's ls the route. So last two here we go here. We have the mnt directory and the media directory. They both do the same thing they mount drives. If you plug in a usb flash drive into your linux box here, it will automatically and auto magically, be mounted to the media directory as a file, because everything's a stinking file, remember so. Media is mainly for your system mounting things automatically for you, whereas the mnt directory it also has drives mounted to it, but it drives you might mount manually. You would actually use commands to mount a drive and again that would be represented as a file in the mnt directory. Now i think we covered most of it, like almost all of it, if you're still curious about any of the remaining ones. Let'S ls that real, quick there are a few we didn't talk about, and maybe a few you want to review, go check out the hack, the box academy right up here. They do go over most of the ones we mentioned here and some we didn't so refer to that wow we covered so much in this video. Oh, you need coffee for this, but it was awesome right. So we like, we saw that everything literally everything in linux is a file and we jumped around the different directories and looked at everything from devices to commands to configuration files and we covered what the main directories actually are for and that's key in learning linux. Because when you are doing stuff in linux, when you're messing with applications or configuring things or hacking, it's important to know where stuff is and where stuff should go. And then, while we were jumping around and exploring our linux file system, which officially is called the fhs, how it's arranged the file system hierarchy, while doing that, we learned a bunch of new commands. Things like who am i cp or copy rm or remove? Add user, which cat? So we did a lot today, so here's my homework for you. I want you to first make flash cards of all these commands. I want you to commit these suckers to memory. Second, i want you to practice using these jump around. If you forget who you are type in, who am i copy things? Remove things be careful though, although if you're using this hack, the box lab, you can just restart it, it's fine witch cat which cat all kinds of stuff cat cat. The more you practice, the faster you'll, learn linux, the better an engineer, you'll become now, that's your homework, but i also have a challenge for you. I always have a challenge: let's see what you got and i'll actually have that quiz linked below the first one to get all the answers. Right will win a gift card to network chuck coffee, so you can grab yourself some coffee or a shirt or a mug or whatever hurry up. Well guys, that's about it huge shout out again to the sponsor of the series hack, the box academy. This is the structured learning platform for hack, the box. It'S where you want to come to learn how to hack and also it's what you can use right now as a free lab as you go through this course. So if you haven't already signed up, i mean what are you doing? You can practice for free right now, right now and of course, don't forget to hack the youtube algorithm today hit that, like button subscribe notification bell comment all that stuff, let's hack, youtube today, ethically of course, and yeah - that's about all i have. This was episode. Two of my linux for hackers and everyone course i'll catch. You guys next time, [ Music, ], you
